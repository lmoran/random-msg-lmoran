# random-messages

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-lmoranmessages
```

# Usage

```bash
random-msg2
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [random-msg-lmoran](https://lmoran.github.io/random-msg-lmoran)
